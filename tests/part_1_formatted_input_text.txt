Jack and Jill were hiking up the hill to buy some mineral water.  Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a pothole in the road, fell down, and broke his smartphone.  “Oh dear!” said Jack.  Well, he actually shouted a stream of expletives their mother wouldn’t approve of, then made some colourful comments about the state of the roads and the local council.  Jill was so shocked she didn’t look where she was going and tumbled down the hill herself.  The pair went home to mend Jack's phone.  Jill suggested putting it in rice.  Jack's response got him grounded for a week, and his phone was never the same again.
